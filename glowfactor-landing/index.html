            <!-- Opening Hook -->
            <div class="article-content">
                <p class="lead-paragraph">Imagine waking up, looking in the mirror, and seeing the face you had ten
                    years ago. Not "improved" by filters. Not Photoshopped. <em>Actually younger.</em></p>

                <p>For Sarah Henderson, a 54-year-old high school teacher from Chicago, this wasn't a dream—it became
                    her reality in just 14 days.</p>

                <p>"I had spent <strong>over $4,000</strong> in the past year alone on high-end department store
                    creams," Sarah told us in a recent phone interview. "La Mer, Augustinus Bader, SkinCeuticals... I
                    even considered Botox injections, but the cost—and the 'frozen' look I saw on my sister—terrified
                    me."</p>

                <p>Then Sarah's dermatologist quietly recommended something different. Something that wasn't advertised
                    on TV. Something the big beauty companies didn't want her to know about.</p>

                <div class="pull-quote">
                    "After two weeks, my husband stopped mid-sentence and said, 'What did you do? You look like you're
                    glowing from within.' That's when I knew it was working."
                    <cite>— Sarah H., Chicago, IL</cite>
                </div>

                <p>Sarah had discovered <strong>GlowFactor</strong>—and within a month, her crow's feet had diminished
                    by 60%, her forehead lines were barely visible, and strangers were asking if she'd had "work done."
                </p>

                <p>She hadn't. She'd simply found the formula the beauty industry hoped you'd never see.</p>

                            <p>GlowFactor wasn't born in a corporate boardroom. It was born in a cramped university lab
                                in Austin, Texas, in 2019.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Lisa Jarkasi, a board-certified pharmacist with advanced training in dermatological
                                science,
                                had spent 15 years watching her patients spend fortunes on skincare that simply
                                <em>didn't work</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>"The problem," Dr. Rao explains, "is that 98% of serums never penetrate past the top
                                layer of skin. They evaporate. They sit on the surface. It's like putting a band-aid on
                                a broken bone."</p>
                            <p>Her breakthrough came when her team discovered a way to encapsulate active ingredients
                                in <strong>lipid nano-particles</strong>—the same technology used in cutting-edge
                                vaccines—to deliver peptides and retinoids <em>directly</em> to the dermis, where
                                collagen is actually produced.</p>
                            <p>The results were so dramatic, she knew she couldn't keep it locked in a lab. She had to
                                bring it to the women who needed it most.</p>

                    <p>Most anti-aging serums rely on molecules that are simply too large to penetrate skin. They sit on
                        the epidermis, provide temporary hydration, and wash off in the shower. You feel good for an
                        hour. Then nothing.</p>

                    <p>GlowFactor's proprietary <strong>NanoSphere Delivery System™</strong> uses lipid nano-particles
                        (each smaller than 100 nanometers) to transport active ingredients through the skin barrier and
                        into the dermis—where collagen, elastin, and new skin cells are actually generated.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How quickly will I see results?</h4>
                    <p>Most customers report feeling immediate hydration and plumping within the first application.
                        Visible reduction in fine lines typically occurs within 7-14 days. For deep wrinkles and
                        significant structural improvements, we recommend using GlowFactor consistently for 30+ days.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is GlowFactor safe for sensitive skin?</h4>
                    <p>Yes! GlowFactor was formulated by Board-Certified Dermatologists specifically for all skin types,
                        including sensitive skin. Our encapsulated retinol delivery system prevents the irritation
                        commonly associated with retinoids. However, as with any new skincare product, we recommend a
                        patch test first.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Can I use GlowFactor with my current skincare routine?</h4>
                    <p>Absolutely. GlowFactor is designed to integrate seamlessly into any routine. Apply it after
                        cleansing and before your moisturizer. However, we recommend avoiding other retinol products
                        while using GlowFactor.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What if I don't see results? Can I get a refund?</h4>
                    <p>Of course! We offer a no-questions-asked, 60-day money-back guarantee. If you're not thrilled
                        with your results, simply email support@glowfactorlabs.com and we'll refund your entire
                        purchase—even if the bottles are empty.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How long does one bottle last?</h4>
                    <p>Each 30ml bottle is designed to last approximately 30 days with twice-daily use. This is why our
                        3-month and 6-month supplies offer significantly better value.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is GlowFactor tested on animals?</h4>
                    <p>Never. GlowFactor is 100% cruelty-free and Leaping Bunny certified. We also use sustainable,
                        eco-friendly packaging.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Where is GlowFactor manufactured?</h4>
                    <p>GlowFactor is proudly formulated and manufactured in an FDA-registered, GMP-compliant facility in
                        Austin, Texas, USA. We use the highest quality, pharmaceutical-grade ingredients.</p>

                    <h4>How long will shipping take?</h4>
                    <p>Standard shipping typically takes 5-7 business days within the US. Express shipping (free on 3+
                        bottle orders) delivers within 2-3 business days. International shipping is available and takes
                        10-14 business days.</p>
