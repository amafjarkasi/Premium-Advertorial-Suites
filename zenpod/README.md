# 🧘 ZenPod Wearable Landing Page

## Niche: Mindfulness, Meditation, & Apple-Esque Hardware

A minimal, "breathable" landing page that mirrors the experience of using a premium wellness device. 

### 🌬️ Marketing Components
- **The "Zen" Aesthetic:** High-key lighting, soft rounded corners, and massive negative space to lower the user's stress upon landing.
- **Problem/Solution Narrative:** Focuses on the chaos of modern life vs. the silence provided by the device.
- **Benefit-Centric Features:** Instead of "Technical Specs," we focus on "Better Sleep," "Focused Work," and "Deep Rest."
- **Influencer/Partner Strip:** High-authority brand associations.

### 🛠️ Technical Features
- **Fluid Grid:** Adapts perfectly to tablet and mobile viewports with zero layout shift.
- **Elegant Animations:** Soft fades and scale-ins that don't distract but rather guide the user's eye.
- **Accordion FAQ:** Clean interaction to keep the page feeling organized.
- **optimized Imagery:** Heavy use of high-resolution device mockups in WebP format.

### 📁 Asset List
